## Choice of critical sections
Map. Our critical sections (0,1,2,3) can be seen in the figure below

                X X X X X X X X X X X
                X             Station           //NORTH
                X   X X X X X X X X X
                X   X
                X X 0 X X X X 1 1 1 1
                    X         X     1
                    X X X X X X     1
                                    1
                3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1
                3   X           X
                3   X X X X X X X
                3
                3 3 3 X X X X X X X X
                    X         Station           //SOUTH
                    X X X X X X X X X

As one can see, our solution has 4 critical sections.
Section 0 is the "North Crossing".
Section 1 starts at the "North Switch" and ends when the "Overtake sections begins".
Section 2 is the "Overtake Section".
Section 3 lies between the "Overtake Section" and the "South Switch".

Section 0,1 and 3 is places where the two trains could crash into each other, since both trains has to cross them in order to
reach the other station. Section 2 only covers the primary track in the "Overtake section". If that section is occupied, an
incoming train will choose the alternative track.

## Placement of sensors
First of all we have sensors at the end of each critical section, in both directions.
Because all of our sections more or less looks like this:

Track >  ...X X X C R I T I C A L X X X... < Track
                X                 X
Track >  ...X X X                 X X X... < Track

This means that every section has 4 sensors that are used when a train is leaving that section, lets call them "Leaving sensors".
In addition to these we also have sensors placed in the same manner but a bit further away from the critical sections than the
leaving sensors. We call these sensors "Entering sensors"
When these sensors are hit the train checks if it can enter the critical section or not.
Lastly, we have sensors at every station, in order to know when to stop and change direction.
TOTAL: 28 sensors

## Maximum train speed and the reason for it
The maximum speed we can handle seems to be 25. The reason why we can't go any faster is because the trains braking distance
gets to long and it unintentionally enters the critical section.
Increasing the distance between the critical section and it's "Entering sensors" or adding more of these would enable us to have
trains that are going faster.
